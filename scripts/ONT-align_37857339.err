Too many arguments.
Usage: samtools fasta [options...] <in.bam>

Description:
Converts a SAM, BAM or CRAM to FASTA format.

Options:
  -0 FILE      write reads designated READ_OTHER to FILE
  -1 FILE      write reads designated READ1 to FILE
  -2 FILE      write reads designated READ2 to FILE
  -o FILE      write reads designated READ1 or READ2 to FILE
               note: if a singleton file is specified with -s, only
               paired reads will be written to the -1 and -2 files.
  -d, --tag TAG[:VAL]
               only include reads containing TAG, optionally with value VAL
  -f, --require-flags INT
               only include reads with all  of the FLAGs in INT present [0]
  -F, --excl[ude]-flags INT
               only include reads with none of the FLAGs in INT present [0x900]
      --rf, --incl[ude]-flags INT
               only include reads with any  of the FLAGs in INT present [0]
  -G INT       only EXCLUDE reads with all  of the FLAGs in INT present [0]
  -n           don't append /1 and /2 to the read name
  -N           always append /1 and /2 to the read name
  -s FILE      write singleton reads designated READ1 or READ2 to FILE
  -t           copy RG, BC and QT tags to the FASTA header line
  -T TAGLIST   copy arbitrary tags to the FASTA header line, '*' for all
      --input-fmt-option OPT[=VAL]
               Specify a single input file format option in the form
               of OPTION or OPTION=VALUE
      --reference FILE
               Reference sequence FASTA FILE [null]
  -@, --threads INT
               Number of additional threads to use [0]
      --verbosity INT
               Set level of verbosity

The files will be automatically compressed if the file names have a .gz
or .bgzf extension.  The input to this program must be collated by name.
Run 'samtools collate' or 'samtools sort -n' to achieve this.

Reads are designated READ1 if FLAG READ1 is set and READ2 is not set.
Reads are designated READ2 if FLAG READ1 is not set and READ2 is set.
Otherwise reads are designated READ_OTHER (both flags set or both flags unset).
Run 'samtools flags' for more information on flag codes and meanings.

The index-format string describes how to parse the barcode and quality tags.
It is made up of 'i' or 'n' followed by a length or '*'.  For example:
   i14i8       The first 14 characters are index 1, the next 8 are index 2
   n8i14       Ignore the first 8 characters, and use the next 14 for index 1

If the tag contains a separator, then the numeric part can be replaced with
'*' to mean 'read until the separator or end of tag', for example:
   i*i*        Break the tag at the separator into index 1 and index 2
   n*i*        Ignore the left part of the tag until the separator,
               then use the second part of the tag as index 1

Examples:
To get just the paired reads in separate files, use:
   samtools fasta -1 pair1.fa -2 pair2.fa -0 /dev/null -s /dev/null -n in.bam

To get all non-supplementary/secondary reads in a single file, redirect
the output:
   samtools fasta in.bam > all_reads.fa
