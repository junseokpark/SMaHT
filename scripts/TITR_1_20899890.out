Working on mosaic "clip" step!
Clip cutoff: 2, 2, 0 are used!!!
Input bam /n/no_backup2/bch/lee/data/mixedDataRetroSom/A_200x/TITR_1.recal.sorted.bam is sequenced from illumina platform!
Clip cutoff is small (<=3), keep all the clipped reads (initial cutoff set as 1)!!!
Initial minimum clip cutoff is 1
